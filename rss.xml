            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the 50-year-quest to build a mechanical heart</h1><p>Steve Williams couldn't breathe. The former athlete had cardiomyopathy, which occasionally choked his lungs with fluid, making him gasp for air. But this felt different; Williams felt like he was dying. He was raced to an Orange County hospital, and shortly after checking in, his heart stopped.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b549ead2fb9a7fa519a3753562641e61bb5f6855.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Michelle Obama 360: An exclusive look at how the First Lady mastered social media</h1><p>The First Lady needed a turnip. By the fall of 2014, "Turn Down for What," Lil Jon and DJ Snake's triple-platinum trap-meets-EDM single, had swallowed pop culture whole. Jimmy Fallon and Robin Wright were dancing to it on The Tonight Show; Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum posed while it blared on the soundtrack of 22 Jump Street; across YouTube, teens and kittens bobbed their heads along.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e687fc336a9551ad771cdfa60856c01cee27fd44.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Future of TV</h1><p>Matt McRae is fired up about remote controls. Or, more specifically, about getting rid of them.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wow!</h1><p>The Mazda Miata has a new, hardtop brother: a targa called the Mazda MX-5 RF. In front of a packed house of journalists in a Chelsea loft, Mazda execs rolled out the car, which looks exactly like what you'd expect (only a lot, lot better) - a Mazda Miata with a hardtop, but with a gorgeously complicated targa roof retraction mechanism.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aa6486d647f28b3780d5b05ce64e3402fa3aa110.jpg"></article>]]></description>
