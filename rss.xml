            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ty Mitchell</h1><p>Heading in that direction, you see his back is turned. He's balancing on the back two legs of a ratty chair, pencil-thin legs crossed and resting on a tree stump. Petting his Blue Heeler, he pulls from a pale blue-andwhite can of beer that he rests on the scorched grass.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/78eef4e5a7294c511a1d28cf896718d1c0a64b7d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Teams decided at the season-opening race in Australia to ditch the new elimination system and revert to the one that had been in place for 2015.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d6e3c1e5c6f894bec20a72f2339c3930e2074e4f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the 50-year-quest to build a mechanical heart</h1><p>Steve Williams couldn't breathe. The former athlete had cardiomyopathy, which occasionally choked his lungs with fluid, making him gasp for air. But this felt different; Williams felt like he was dying. He was raced to an Orange County hospital, and shortly after checking in, his heart stopped.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b549ead2fb9a7fa519a3753562641e61bb5f6855.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Michelle Obama 360: An exclusive look at how the First Lady mastered social media</h1><p>The First Lady needed a turnip. By the fall of 2014, "Turn Down for What," Lil Jon and DJ Snake's triple-platinum trap-meets-EDM single, had swallowed pop culture whole. Jimmy Fallon and Robin Wright were dancing to it on The Tonight Show; Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum posed while it blared on the soundtrack of 22 Jump Street; across YouTube, teens and kittens bobbed their heads along.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e687fc336a9551ad771cdfa60856c01cee27fd44.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Future of TV</h1><p>Matt McRae is fired up about remote controls. Or, more specifically, about getting rid of them. McRae is the chief technology officer of Vizio, a company that sells more TVs - and with them, remotes - than any other company in America. And he thinks remote controls are very, very stupid.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e4d5762ce0e2153a6fee5135bd9a2b8293ee7a54.png"></article>]]></description>
