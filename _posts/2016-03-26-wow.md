description: "The Mazda Miata has a new, hardtop brother: a targa called the Mazda MX-5 RF. In front of a packed house of journalists in a Chelsea loft, Mazda execs rolled out the car, which looks exactly like what you'd expect (only a lot, lot better) - a Mazda Miata with a hardtop, but with a gorgeously complicated targa roof retraction mechanism."
